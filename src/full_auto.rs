//! Full auto — cold-and-dark to a flown circuit, one command.
//!
//! An ORCHESTRATOR, not new flight logic: it drives the aircraft through the
//! whole gate-to-gate sequence by invoking the SAME tested tools the pilot
//! would, in order, waiting on each before the next:
//!
//!   power up -> start engine -> altimeter -> REQUEST TAXI from the tower
//!   -> (pushback if nose-in) -> auto-taxi to the hold -> line up -> fly the
//!   circuit (takeoff, pattern, land, stop).
//!
//! No blanket brake release anywhere in the chain: the brakes stay as the
//! pilot left them until something actually drives — the taxi governor,
//! pushback and auto-takeoff each release at their own moment (the stage-2
//! release left an idle jet brakeless during the tug wait and it crept into
//! the grass, Luton 2026-07-28).
//!
//! The taxi route is the tower's to give — the copilot can't invent one — so
//! this transmits "request taxi" and drives whatever clearance comes back
//! (needs COM1 on the tower/ground and a station running). Every stage is
//! abortable with "my controls" / "cancel", and each blackboxes as
//! `"kind":"full_auto"`. EXPERIMENTAL: eight subsystems in a chain — fly it
//! VMC, hand ready, and mine the blackbox after.
